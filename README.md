# Holdi Board

Welcome to the **Holdi Board** repository! This application is a simulator built using Python and Streamlit, designed to simulate investment performance based on your individual profile and asset allocation. It provides a straightforward interface to interact with investment scenarios to help optimize your financial planning.

## Features

-   **Performance Simulation**: Simulate the potential performance of your investments based on various profiles and asset allocations (`app.py`) 
-   **Data Analysis**: Includes a Jupyter Notebook (`data_handling.ipynb`) to convert input from Excel Sheet to SQLite database 
-   **Local Database**: Utilize a SQLite database (`data/investment_data.db`) to store and manage simulation data.
